### Server

Server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client.

The client requests the server for some data and the server responds to the request.

**Advantages of using a server**

- Efficient storage and delivery of information

- Customized user experience

- Controlled access to content

- Notifications and communications

### HTTP

HTTP ( **Hypertext** Transfer Protocol ) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is used to send and receive webpages and files on the internet.

It was initially made to set certain rules and regulations for the transfer of HTML ( **Hypertext** Markup Language ) files.
